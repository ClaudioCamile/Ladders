People usually do not think about ladders until they have to climb one. Still, it is a common thing, seen in a variety of places - a tool used to access roofs, lofts and other high places.

That's correct and accurate , but when it comes to describing the self development Individuals mankind, the scale takes on a deeper - pictorial - metaphorical meaning.

I really like ladders, since I was young, I loved to climb them, walk on them and imagine how I climb more and more, up, and higher than that, to the summit, to the fresh and clear air.

And there, in that place, begins to dream my life.

Every person is entitled to dream his own life, even if it remains a dream, but for him it mait be a reality.

How good there is around us, and in ourselves,just to look and observe and say thank you.

Every piece of code we write that can leverage many people's lives is a virtual ladder, and writing this journey [line by line] is like a real climb to a new frontier, which then later, many others can also rise by it.

So it would be wise to take seriously what we do, respect and rejoice in the involvement in the fabric of life - Ours and everyone's.
