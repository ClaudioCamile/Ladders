People usually do not think about ladders until they have to climb one. 
Still, it is a common thing, seen in a variety of places - a tool used to access roofs, lofts and other high places.

Everything is accurate and correct, 
but when it comes to describing the development in man, 
the scale takes on a deeper - pictorial - metaphorical meaning. 

I really like ladders, since I was young, 
I loved to climb them, walk on them and imagine how I climb more and more, 
up, and higher than that, 
to the summit, 
to the fresh and clear air.

And there, in that place, begins to dream my life. 

Every person is entitled to dream his own life, even if it remains a dream, for him it is a reality. 

How good there is around us, and in ourselves, 

just to look and observe and say thank you.
